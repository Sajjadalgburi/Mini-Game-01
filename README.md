# Mini-Game-01

## Description

For this project, I drew inspiration from the mini-game module that is a part of my bootcamp's Javascript activity folder. The reason behind this choice is that I needed to immerse myself in Javascript, as it is the only way to improve as a programmer. I encountered several issues with Javascript syntax, including understanding various functions and effectively communicating my intentions to the program. Communicating with computers, such as making a rock-paper-scissors game functional, is challenging. However, I anticipate many upcoming challenges that I have to face, and overcoming them will undoubtedly be a step in the right direction.

While this project lacks any HTML markup or CSS styling, my main focus has been on the Javascript aspect. Furthermore, I hope that in the upcoming future, I will be able to make this game much more fun and interactive!
